Intro:
Today is Monday. You've been busy coordinating student tours and doing other extracurricular work for a while now. 
Your name is well known amongst the student body. You figure you'd start your day right by getting some breakfast from the student center but 
when you arrive things are not how they normally are. The panther statue next to the student center has been defaced in bright red marker and 
several students have gathered to witness the ensuing madness.
