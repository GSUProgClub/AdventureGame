# AdventureGame

_Synopsis_:
The Adventure Game starts with the player being accused of some form of vandalism that
has taken place on the panther statue outside of the Student Center. It is your job
to find evidence that supports your innocence, and to clear your name!

_Things needed to win the game_:
You will need four crucial pieces of evidence to reach
the game win scenario. These four pieces of evidence are:
> The Receipt of Total Sale
> The Red Marker
> The Security Tape
> Xavier's Recounted Testimony

_Walkthrough_
The player starts by being confronted by the campus cop, Steve Sminkle. After entering your name and choosing from the starting dialogue, you will be placed in Langdale Hall.
Examine Xavier in order to start dialogue with him. After questioning Xavier, he will tell you that Glenda the girl scout who is at her cookie stall at the Student Center might know more.
From here, exit Langdale Hall using the "go outside" prompt and then "go further east" twice to reach the Student Center. From there we can access the cookie stall. 

Interrogating Glenda will result in no information being added, so you'll have to flatter her and ask if there's anything you can help with and if she wants to be nominated for an award. After these prompts you'll receive the Red Marker and the Receipt of Total Sale respectively. You'll also want to buy cookies from Glenda for later.
Once you have the Receipt of Total Sale, the Red Marker, and the Cookies, go back to Langdale Hall and "go downstairs". Once downstairs, examine The Janitor, who upon seeing the Cookies will offer the keys in exchange for the cookies.

Now, with the keys, go to the Admissions Office and go down the hallway. Once down the hallway, examine The Wall Safe. Opening the wall safe with the keys will give you the Security Tape.

One more trip back to Langdale Hall to talk to Xavier will result in his Recounted Testimony, which is the fourth and final piece of evidence needed.

Finally, with all four pieces of evidence, go to Steve Sminkle at the Admissions Office and examine him. This will have you enter into dialogue with Steve and results in GAME WIN.
